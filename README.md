| Two Dice Pig App | Mobile Application Design and Implementation/ CIS 436 | JAVA | Create a basic dice game called Two-Dice Pig.There are two dice and two players competing against one another: If the player rolls a single 1, they score nothing, and it becomes the next player’s turn. If the player rolls both 1s, their total score is lost, and their turn ends. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total, and the player’s turn continues. If a player chooses to hold, their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player’s turn. If a double (both same face value, but not 1s) is rolled, the point total is added to their turn total like normal, BUT the player is obligated to roll again. This means that they cannot choose to HOLD for the next roll, i.e., the HOLD option is disabled. The first player to 50 wins. USE: Buttons, Image Views, and Text Views.
| Converter App - Temperature & Distance | Mobile Application Design and Implementation/ CIS 436 | JAVA | Create a Converter app using a menu system in the overflow action menu, consisting of two options: • Temperatures • Distances. The primary intent that is displayed initially is for temperatures.  On this intent, allow the user to convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius (F to C and C to F). The distances intent allows the user to convert distances in the Imperial and the Metric systems.  So, allow conversions between kilometers and miles (km to mi, mi to km). In addition, when a user is in either screen, Manage the data so that if the user rotates the screen or leaves the app, that the input is restored to the screen. USE: Text View, Edit Text, Radio Group, Button, Checkbox.
| Weather App - 5 Day Forecase | Mobile Application Design and Implementation/ CIS 436 | JAVA | The first screen (activity) allows the user to select from 5 cities that are in a dropdown menu.  Once they select the city, another activity will be loaded with an intent, including the extra information about what city was selected. The second activity sends a request to the DarkSky API, and receives the JSON data about the weather for that city, and displays it. USE: Text View, Scroll View.
| COVID_19 App | Mobile Application Design and Implementation/ CIS 436 | JAVA | COVID-19 App could be used to get updated information about the cases of COVID-19 patients. Using this app, user can easily get the updated numbers of total COVID-19 cases, total death due to COVID-19 and total recoveries across the world.

User can also select to get the information of total cases of COVID-19 patients for each State in the US which is mostly sorted based on the number of cases (State with larger number appears first). Home Page: Multiple TextView are used with different style to show the information about what is the updated total confirmed cases, total deaths and total recoveries due to COVID-19 and LinearLayout has been used for this information. There is an option menu on the top right of the Home page. Menu Option: Option Menu will give users three options – Home: Go back to Home fragment/page, Country- Will show another page that shows total cases of COVID-19 patients of all the countries across the world, Only US Cases – Will show another page with information about total cases of COVID-19 patients for each state in the United States.	Country Fragment/page (Country option selected): When user choose “Country” from option menu, a toast message will pop up to indicate that country option has been selected.

USA Fragment/Page (Only US cases selected): When user choose “Only US Cases” from option menu, a toast message will pop up to indicate that the USA option has been selected. User will be able to see the total number of COVID-19 cases for every State within the United States sorted based on the number of cases (State with larger number appears first). USE: ProgressBar(Widget): Whenever user chooses to go to an activity from another activity by selecting any of the options from Option Menu, a graphical view of a progress bar will be shown to indicate the completing of the task of showing the new page.
